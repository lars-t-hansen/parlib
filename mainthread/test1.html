<p> This tests that it's OK for the main thread to block while the
slave is computing.  The way it does that is to set up a bounded
buffer problem with a short buffer and then transfering items from the
worker to the master.  The master throws the items away but the worker
has to spend some time producing them, so the master will mostly work.
Every 100 items the master returns to its event loop.
