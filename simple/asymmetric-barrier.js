// MasterBarrier / WorkerBarrier.
//
// This is a simple master/worker barrier that is mapped to locations
// within a shared integer array.
//
// Overview
// --------
// The master and workers all create private barrier objects, which
// reference some working locations in shared memory.  When the
// workers have all entered the barrier the master receives a
// callback.  The master must then release the workers again for them
// to resume computing.
//
// Usage
// -----
// The master must create a MasterBarrier, and then ensure that
// Master.dispatch is invoked when a worker's onmessage handler
// receives a message that the workers are all in the barrier.  That
// message is an array of the form ["MasterBarrier.dispatch", ID]
// where ID is the barrier ID.
//
// The workers must each create a WorkerBarrier on the same shared
// locations and with the same ID as the master barrier.  The
// WorkerBarriers must not be created until after the MasterBarrier
// constructor has returned.
//
// The application is responsible for allocating the locations in the
// integer array and communicating those and the ID to the workers.
//
// The number of consecutive array locations needed is given by
// MasterBarrier.NUMLOCS.

// Create the master side of a barrier.
//
// - 'iab' is a SharedInt32Array
// - 'ibase' is the first of several consecutive locations within 'iab'
// - 'ID' identifies the barrier globally
// - 'numWorkers' is the number of workers that will coordinate
// - 'callback' is the function that is to be called when the workers
//   are all waiting in the barrier with this ID.
